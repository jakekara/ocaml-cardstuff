# card stuff

Just wanted to start playing around with very rudimentary simulations, and brush up on OCaml, since I don't get to use it as much as I'd like on a daily basis.

The  "simulation" right now just generates a fresh, ordered deck of cards, then shuffles it and draws the first five cards, over and over again until it hits a royal flush, then repeats 10 times and calculates the average number of deals needed to be dealt a royal flush.
